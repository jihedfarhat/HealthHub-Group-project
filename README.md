# HealthHub - Your Fitness Companion


HealthHub is a comprehensive fitness tracking application that helps users monitor their physical activities, track their progress, and understand the impact of their workouts on their calorie expenditure. This project was developed as the final submission for the Coding Dojo Africa web development bootcamp, utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

## Key Features

- **Activity Tracking**: Users can log their fitness activities, including walking, running, cycling, and swimming. The application calculates the number of calories burned based on the user's physical characteristics and the intensity of the activity.

- **User Profiles**: Users can create and manage their profiles, which include information such as weight, height, gender, and age. This data is used to personalize the calorie burn calculations.

- **Historical Data**: Users can view their past fitness activities and track their progress over time, enabling them to monitor their performance and set new goals.

- **Intuitive Interface**: The application provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily log their activities, view their stats, and navigate through the different features.

## Technologies Used
