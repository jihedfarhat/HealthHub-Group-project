# HealthHub-Group-project
This project represents our team's final submission after completing the Coding Dojo Africa web development bootcamp. We will be using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for development.
The project includes several helper functions to calculate the calorie burn for different types of activities, taking into account the user's weight, height, gender, and age. These functions use the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) values and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) calculations to estimate the number of calories burned during the activity.
